# vAlias
A simple alias viewing and backup utility.

### Script Purpose as a Tool:
Provides simplicity in viewing alias file entries. Allows for sorting the alias file by name or command. When viewing alias entries, option for Backup, Save As, and Edit Copy are available. Open the terminal window from the main menu to test any system changes that you have made directly. **NOTE:** The script vAlias does not directly edit any system files. The vAlias script makes a copy of the '~/.bash_aliases' file to a temporary folder for viewing, opening, editing and saving. 


### Setup:
Setup:
1) Save the vAlias.sh file to a directory.
2) Make the vAlias.sh script executable by running the following command in the same directory as the pSupply.sh file:<br/>
_chmod +x vAlias.sh_

### Features:
- Easily view and sort alias commands.
- Backup current alias command list.
- Edit a copy of the alias command list.
- Save the alias command list as a separate file.
- Refresh the alias view as you make direct changes.
- Copy a selected alias command to the system clipboard.
- Open the terminal to test alias changes from the menu.
- Specify the command used to open a terminal session.
- Use the 'F1' key for documentation from any main window.

### Typical Usage:
Upon opening the vAlias script, click on the option for "View Alias". This will show you a list of all alias commands from a copied '~/.bash_aliases' file. Easily sort, save, and edit as needed. A double click on a alias command entry will show you the details of that command where you can copy the command to the system clipboard. Open the terminal using the "Terminal" option where you can test your direct changes.
